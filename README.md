# Doctrine 2 State Machine

State machines for Doctrine entities

Note: this lib is a work in progress. Nothing finished yet.

## Why

State machines when used to enforce the workflow of DB records, need to be deeply integrated with the underlying DBMS in order to retain data integrity in a highly concurrency environment.

eg. Suppose you're working on an eCommerce with limited inventory, you wouldn't want to sell the same item to more than one person. That is why a state machine should adopt a locking strategy on the DB in order to prevent double state updates on the same record.
